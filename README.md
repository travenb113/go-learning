# 📘 go-learning

Welcome to **go-learning** — my first personal repository for learning the Go programming language (Golang).  
This repo includes basic hands-on examples, experiments, and notes as I explore the language step by step.

## 🚀 How to Run

To run any example:

```bash
cd ProjectGo
go run file_name.go
```
## 🤓 Funny and Quick Fact

I’ve returned to this very repository **more than once** after “finishing” just to re-learn what I forgot.  
Turns out Go is easy to start, but even easier to forget when you close your editor too long — *even if it's just for a little while*.
